Sample Photo Editor<br>
This Python script is a simple photo editor application built using the Streamlit library. The app allows users to capture images using their webcam and convert them to grayscale. Additionally, the app provides a feature to upload images from the user's local file system and convert them to grayscale as well. The purpose of this app is to explore the features of streamlit by building a simple yet fully functional web application.
